## Overview

There comes a time in any software engineer's life when they are forced to process CSV files. Unfortunately the CSV encoder/decoder that is included with the Go standard library requires quite a lot of boilerplate to be useful. Package csvbuddy takes the pain away by implementing an encoding/decoding interface comparable with `encoding/json` on top of it.

## Install

```
go get -u github.com/askeladdk/csvbuddy
```

## Quickstart

## License

Package csvbuddy is released under the terms of the ISC license.
